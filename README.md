<h2>Special Note</h1>
<p>While I (<a href="https://v3rmillion.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1763716">reggie</a>) orignally came up and theorized about some of this method, we definately couldn't have done this without each-other! The bot/self-bot (proprietary) and extensions (The Lua code in this repo too) were "re"written by <a href="https://v3rmillion.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1149709">LuaPhysics</a>. <a href="https://v3rmillion.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=2719846">Zu</a> also greatly helped with this operation/project, and even made a little GUI for messing with everyone! (Keeping that proprietary too ;))</p>

<h2>Use/Installation</h2>
<p>This entire open sourced project was part of another, bigger project we're keeping proprietary. You will <i>mostly</i> be on your own with modification and what-not, but here is some basic instruction:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://github.com/latte-soft/flm/zipball/master">Download this repository as a .zip file</a>, or just use <code>git clone</code> if you have and are familiar with git.</li>
    <li>Copy <code>flm_init.lua</code> into Synapse's <code>autoexec</code> folder.</li>
    <li>Copy the <code>flm</code> folder into Synapse's <code>workspace</code> folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Afterwards, you should just be able to join any game and watch the "magic" happen!</p>
